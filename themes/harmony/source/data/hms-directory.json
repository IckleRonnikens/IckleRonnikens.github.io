In fact, it's happened enough that there are rules in place to discourage such a thing.

But more than that, the attitudes displayed by his fellow students, the faculty, and even Albus Dumbledore himself leave him wondering if anyone he knows actually has his best interests at heart. Together with Hermione Granger (with whom he's recently rekindled an estranged friendship) and the tiny aid of an enterprising first-year named Mafalda, Harry's going to do what he does best.

Surrounded by orphaned children who loathed her for being younger and staff who lived in fear of her ominous abilities, she resigned herself to a meaningless life of misery and regret; one small, irrelevant drop in an uncaring ocean of loneliness and isolation, waiting to be washed ashore and left to silently fade away. That was until she discovered that fate wasn’t quite finished with her yet, as she received a rather strange letter one day. 'Is that...?' She gasped with shock as she inspected the extravagant, flourished letters that swirled in beautiful loops across the front of the perfectly sealed envelope that she held within her small, delicate and suddenly trembling hands. '... is that my name?'",
