introduction: "Harry Potter dies during the war. <br /> Hermione Granger is heartbroken, she tries to move on with her life, but Ron Weasley was never the man for her.<br /> After plenty of fighting they break up, she buries herself in her work, and ends up becoming Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic. One day she inadvertently travels through the Multiverse to another dimension, and finds that there are other worlds parallel with hers, and there are places where Harry Potter is still alive.<br /> There is also Dark Harry Potter, Quidditch Superstar Harry Potter, Minister for Magic Harry Potter, Daddy Harry Potter etc etc…<br /> She eventually finds a universe where Hermione was the one that died during the war and Harry is all alone. There’s much hugging, snogging, and shagging (maybe?). It turns out that their two worlds are the anomaly, that no matter what, neither of them were supposed to die. It didn’t matter if they were good or turned evil at least they remained alive, and Hermione and Harry must figure out a way of merging their two worlds, so there is no longer the anomaly.<br /> However, all of this crossing between dimensions is making the Multiverse unstable, and they must do it quickly, or they risk being lost in other dimensions.<br /> There doesn’t have to be a situation where glitching in another universe occurs, or that it unbalances, or that it’s not impossible to balance in another way."
