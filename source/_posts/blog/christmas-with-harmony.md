Hello, everyone ! The HMS Harmony Discord and this sub have a new event to announce….introducing Christmas with Harmony our joint Christmas Fanart Challenge and Writing Fest!

Whether you are an @Artist or a @Writer , you have from now until Christmas Day (December 25th) to post any fanart or fanfic of a very merry Harmony Christmas!

The rules are simple:

It must be strictly Harmony
It must involve Christmas or other winter celebrations like Hanukkah and Kwanzaa
For fanfics:

Any length fics are allowed, though they must be complete.
We’ve created Ao3 (https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Christmas_With_Harmony_2020) and FFN collections (https://www.fanfiction.net/community/HMS-Harmony-Discord-Writing-Fests-Drabbles-and-Inspired-Fics/133288/) for you to post to should you wish!
Make sure to promote your fics in the discord’s •┊self-promotion channel once they’ve been published!
For fanart:

Please tag us @ hms_harmony if you’re posting on Instagram or @ hms-harmony-discord if you’re posting on Tumblr!
Make sure to use the tag #hhrfanartfriday and #christmaswithharmony
Make sure to promote your fanart in the discord’s fanart channels!
We’re so excited to see your work! Have a safe and fun holidays, everyone.

Thank you to @deleted-role for the beautiful banner.
