Hello everyone. We at HMS Harmony want to present a new challenge to you all! There have previously been challenges such as Reptilia28’s “Don’t Fear the Reaper” challenge which, while beloved and an inspiration for many great stories, has been done many times. It is past time that a new challenge was presented to the Harmony community. This challenge is aimed to be much different in tone and to utllize the potential in a setting that is not seen enough in HHr fics.

Introducing the…. The Jily Meets Harmony Challenge Must include:

1. James/Lily and Harry/Hermione strictly.

2. James and Lily must be alive. Either by surviving Halloween, coming back to life, or their canon deaths never happening/being avoided. (Can include either Time Travel or a Canon Divergence event)

3. Sirius should also live and be free/exonerated.

4. Lily must at some point braid Hermione’s hair.

5. James and Harry must at some point fly together

6. Harry cannot have a Boy Who Lived (Or Wrong Boy Who Lived) sibling.

7. No Jily bashing

8. Include the requirements and description of the challenge in an Author’s Note.

Optional:

1. Line from James: “Are you sure you don’t fancy Hermione?”

2. Line from Lily: “You know, Harry is lucky to have you.”

3. Line from Sirius: “I’m trying to decide which pair of you lovebirds is more [__].”

4. Preferably avoids common tropes (overdone bashing, love potions etc) (edited)


We hope for and highly encourage as many unique ideas as possible! However, if you are having trouble, here are a few possible scenarios that can be used to get you started:

Potential Scenarios to ensure #2 (Jily Lives):

1. Harry and Hermione try their luck with a ritual to bring his parents back to life. They are surprised it works.

2. During the time turner adventure of POA, Harry and Hermione do more than saving Sirius. They go back in time and end up saving them all.

3. James and Lily end up travelling to the future.

4. Harry and Hermione end up being given another chance at life. But have they gone to the past or is this a different dimension entirely?

5. Something happened that fateful night on October 31st that ensured the Potters lived to tell their tale.

Your story can involve anything from Harry and Hermione going back in time, the Potters going forward in time, the Potters never dying, the Potters (or Harry and Hermione) travelling to another dimensions…. The sky’s the limit! This challenge has no expiry date. However, the HMS Discord is encouraging those @Writers who wish to participate to try to post their first chapter by October 31st. Please make sure to list the specific rules of the challenge at the beginning of your story. A night where James and Lily lost it all will now be used to bring them back to life. There will be an AO3 collection (https://archiveofourown.org/collections/The_Jily_Meets_Harmony_Challenge) and a community on FFN (https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Jily-Meets-Harmony-Challenge/132932/) to submit to and all entries will also be featured in the discord. It’s time for Harry to finally have a happy Halloween.
